# Bashchess

I wrote this during [M122](https://www.modulbaukasten.ch/module/122/3/de-DE?title=Abl%C3%A4ufe-mit-einer-Scriptsprache-automatisieren) at GIBB.
Therefore, the comments are written in German... (When I find time and motivation I'll translate them).

I didn't have a lot of time for this project, and therefore it may contain bugs, feel free to report them to me.

### What it does

- Allows you to play chess in your terminal
- Shows you legal moves
- Prevents you from doing illegal moves
- Supports Checkmate and Stalemate

### What it doesn't

- Castling
- 50/75 move rule

### How to play

- Run chess.sh
- Select a piece by pressing the letter and number of the field your piece is on (be careful, once selected you can't change it anymore!)
- All valid moves are marked green, choose one by pressing the number and letter of the target field.
- Enjoy!
